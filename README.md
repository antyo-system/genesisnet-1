# GenesisNet – Autonomous Network for the AI Data Economy  

🌍 Overview  
GenesisNet is an autonomous data economy network built on Fetch.ai agents and Internet Computer (ICP) canisters.
Our mission: decentralize how AI discovers, negotiates, and validates data — enabling a trustless, autonomous marketplace.
Hackathon: Hackathon 16 (Fetch.ai × ICP)  
Team Members:  
Antonius Prasetyo – Backend Developer, AI Engineer (Initiator)  
Natasha Putri – Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer  
Dharil – Technical Support & Contributor  

🚨 The Problem  
AI cannot thrive without high-quality data, yet today’s ecosystem is:
Fragmented – Datasets locked in silos.  
Inefficient – Independent AI devs lack affordable access.  
Untrusted – No transparent way to verify authenticity.  

💡 Our Solution  
GenesisNet introduces a living data marketplace where agents autonomously:
Discover data (Requester Agents).  
Negotiate offers (Provider Agents).  
Enforce trust with on-chain reputation (Reputation Agents).  
All transactions are recorded in immutable ICP canisters.


⚙️ System Architecture  
GenesisNet is built as a full-stack decentralized system, combining autonomous agents, blockchain integration, and a real-time dashboard.
Backend – Microservices + AI Agents  
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Socket.io
Pattern: Microservices architecture
Blockchain: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canisters
Real-time: WebSocket broadcasts for live updates
Core Microservices
API Gateway – Main entry point, routes all requests  
Metrics Service – Calculates KPIs and usage metrics  
Search Service – Filters providers and datasets  
Network Service – Manages node topology (scan, ping, discovery)  
Transaction Service – Handles payments & ICP ledger integration  
WebSocket Service – Publishes live updates (metrics/logs/topology)  
Blockchain Service – Calls ICP canisters for logging & reputation  
Database (PostgreSQL)
users – Buyers  
providers – Data sellers  
data_packages – Data inventory  
transactions – Transaction records  
network_nodes – Nodes for visualization  
activity_logs – Real-time activity  
Backend Flows
Dashboard Init – API returns metrics, topology, logs to frontend  
Search Data – User filters → DB query → return results + metrics  
Real-time Updates – Every 3s recalc → WebSocket broadcast → live UI  
Network Scan – Ping nodes → update topology → broadcast changes  
Transaction – Validate request → ICP transfer → monitor blockchain → complete/rollback  
API Endpoints

GET /api/dashboard/logs  
GET /api/network/topology  
POST /api/data/search  
POST /api/network/scan  
WebSocket Events

Security
JWT authentication, input validation  
Rate limiting & CORS rules  
Wallet signature verification  
Monitoring
Health checks  
Performance & query monitoring  
WebSocket connection tracking  

Frontend – 3-Panel Dashboard
Tech Stack: React (Vite), D3.js/Vis.js, @dfinity/agent
UI Layout
Left (Control Panel): Input search criteria  
Center (Network Visualization): Live topology of requester & providers  
Right (Log/Overview): Transparent transaction log  
Bottom (Metrics): KPIs (transactions, latency, reputation scores)  
User Flow

User enters criteria → triggers Data Requester Agent  
Provider agents respond → offers visualized as flashing edges  
Requester finalizes → ICP logs transaction → Reputation updated  
UI updates all 3 panels in real-time  
This layout = cockpit design:
Input (left) → Live process (center) → Verified output (right).
Judges instantly see the autonomy & decentralization in action.

How Backend & Frontend Connect  
Frontend calls REST APIs & subscribes to WebSocket events for real-time responsiveness.  
Backend microservices orchestrate search, metrics, and ICP transactions.  
ICP canisters ensure immutable logging, payment, and reputation updates.  
Dashboard visualization (network graph + logs) provides a proof-of-concept UX showing that the system is alive, not static.  
UI Components:  
Control Panel (Left): User inputs search criteria.  
Network Visualization (Center): Live topology of agents.  
Real-time Log (Right): Transparent record of offers & transactions.  
Metrics Panel (Bottom): Key stats (transactions, latency).  
This three-panel cockpit design ensures clarity and impact:
Left (Input) → Center (Visual Result) → Right (Details):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
It creates the “wow” moment instantly when judges open the demo.

🔄 How GenesisNet Works  
Requester Agent sends a query (search criteria).  
Provider Agents respond with offers (price, quality, reputation).  
Requester selects the best offer and finalizes the transaction.  
Reputation Agent monitors and updates provider scores on-chain.  
Dashboard visualizes the entire workflow (query → negotiation → transaction).  

## 🧩 Fetch.ai Agents  
| Agent Name          | Role                 | Example Address              |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Data Requester Agent | Search & purchase    | fetch:genesisnet/requester |
| Data Provider Agent  | Provide & sell data  | fetch:genesisnet/provider  |
| Reputation Agent     | Maintain trust score | fetch:genesisnet/reputation |
🏆 Key Features & Advantages  
| Conventional Data Platforms (e.g. Kaggle, Bright Data) | GenesisNet |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Centralized, manual browsing                           | Autonomous, decentralized agents |
| Trust in platform brand                                | Trust via on-chain reputation ledger |
| High fees, intermediaries                              | Minimal cost, direct peer-to-peer |
| Static catalog showcase                                | Live, visualized negotiations & transactions |
Visual Topology = Proof of Autonomy.
Instead of static datasets, we show the process of agents negotiating and transacting live — a clear differentiator.

🚀 How to Run GenesisNet  
Follow these steps to run the project locally. Everything is containerized and scriptable — no need to dig into source code.
1. Clone the Repository  
`git clone https://github.com/<your-team>/genesisnet.git
cd genesisnet`
Start the Backend (Agents + ICP Canisters)
Install Python deps (Fetch.ai uAgents)
pip install uagents
Install Internet Computer SDK
sh -ci "$(curl -sS https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
Launch local ICP replica
dfx start --clean --background
Deploy all canisters (agents, reputation, ledger, etc.)
dfx deploy
Once deployed, you will see canister IDs printed in the terminal — keep these, the frontend will use them.
Start the Frontend Dashboard
Move into frontend folder
cd frontend
Install dependencies
npm install
Run development server
npm run dev
Interact with the System
Enter search criteria in the left panel.
Watch the network visualization come alive in the center.
Track logs and metrics updating in real time on the right & bottom.
Try a purchase flow: Requester → Provider → Reputation update → On-chain log.
🔮 Future Development & Vision  
We see GenesisNet not only as a hackathon prototype, but as the foundation of a decentralized AI data economy.
Planned directions include:
Scaling Agents → Support thousands of requester and provider agents running in parallel.  
Advanced Reputation Model → Move beyond simple counters into trust scoring, fraud detection, and incentive design.  
Multi-chain Support → Extend beyond ICP to other blockchains for interoperability.  
Token Economy → Native token for payments, staking, and reputation collateral.  
Marketplace Expansion → Integration with external datasets, IoT feeds, and real-time APIs.  
UI/UX Enhancements → Richer visualization, multi-agent simulation modes, and mobile access.  
Open Developer Ecosystem → Allow third parties to plug in new agent types and monetize their data/services.  
Our long-term vision: GenesisNet as the trust layer for AI data markets globally — autonomous, transparent, and unstoppable.
